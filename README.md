## About the Developer

Hi! I'm a beginner developer, and I've only been learning web development for about two weeks. This project, **Shopi-Pied**, is my first attempt at building a full product management web application from scratch. Throughout this project, Iâ€™ve been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement basic CRUD functionality.

Although there may still be areas for improvement, I am excited about the progress I've made and I'm eager to continue learning and enhancing my skills as a developer. Any feedback or contributions to help me grow are very welcome!
